# barefootjs/twig

Twig rendering backend (`Barefoot\TwigBackend`) for the BarefootJS PHP
runtime.

This package targets `twig/twig` and pairs with the `@barefootjs/twig`
compile-time adapter, which emits `.twig` templates that call the runtime as
a `bf` object (`{{ bf.scope_attr() }}`, `{{ bf.json(x) }}`,
`{{ bf.spread_attrs(bag) }}`).

The engine-agnostic runtime itself (`Barefoot\BarefootJS`, `Evaluator`,
`SearchParams`, `Json`) lives in a separate package,
[`packages/adapter-php`](../../adapter-php) (`barefootjs/runtime` on
Composer) -- see that package's README for the backend contract every PHP
engine adapter (Twig, Blade, ...) implements.

This package is maintained in the BarefootJS monorepo and is mirrored to a
Packagist-facing repository only for Composer distribution.

mirror automatically.

## Tests

```sh
php tests/test_render.php
```

A live end-to-end Twig render (scope markers, hydration attrs, text slots,
autoescaping, `spread_attrs`, reserved-word mangling). Needs `twig/twig`
installed (`composer install`); skips gracefully with a notice (not a
failure) when `vendor/autoload.php` is absent. The engine-agnostic runtime's
own test suite (golden helper vectors, evaluator vectors, `spread_attrs`,
`omit`, `render_child`, ...) lives in
[`packages/adapter-php/tests`](../../adapter-php/tests) — run with
`php packages/adapter-php/tests/run.php`.
